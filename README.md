## 📧 Email Notifications

When a booking is confirmed, an automated email is sent to the user containing:

* Property name and location
* Check-in and check-out dates
* Number of nights
* Total amount with 18% GST

This is implemented using an **event-driven architecture** — the booking controller emits a `booking.created` event which the notification service listens to asynchronously, so email delivery never slows down the booking response.
